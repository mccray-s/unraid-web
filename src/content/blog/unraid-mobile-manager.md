## Introduction: That Frustrating Moment for NAS Users

As a heavy Unraid user, you've definitely experienced this:

You're at the mall hanging out with family on the weekend, and suddenly you get a WeChat message from a friend using your Plex: "Bro, the movie isn't playing."

At that moment, you awkwardly pull out your phone and type that long, familiar IP address into the browser. What follows is a disaster: on a 6-inch screen, the WebUI text is like ants, and your fingers are clumsy. Zoom in, scroll, type password, zoom in again... After all that, even if you fix it, your blood pressure is already through the roof.

No matter how much the official WebUI has improved, it's ultimately a desktop interface designed for large screens. Forcing it onto a mobile
phone is like running a marathon in a suit—you can do it, but it's definitely not comfortable.

To bridge this "last 10 centimeters" gap in experience, I developed **Unraid Deck**.

My goal was simple: **Make managing your server as smooth and easy as checking your social media feed.**

## Why Do You Need Unraid Deck?

### 1. Native Experience Built for iOS

There are many third-party management tools out there, but most are just simple web wrappers packed into an App, or built roughly with cross-platform frameworks. Unraid Deck is different; it strictly follows the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).

The moment you open the App, it feels incredibly familiar. From fluid transitions to subtle Haptic Feedback, every detail has been polished with care.

The **Dashboard** is no longer a cold pile of data. We've transformed key metrics like CPU load, RAM usage, and array storage into intuitive, elegant visualizations. With **System-level Dark Mode** support, checking your server status late at night is easy on the eyes.

### 2. "God Mode" at Your Fingertips

Containers (Docker) and Virtual Machines (VM) are the soul of Unraid, and also where things go wrong most often.

In Unraid Deck, managing them becomes a pleasure.
Imagine the next time Plex freezes, you just need to:
1. Pull out your phone and unlock with FaceID instantly.
2. Spot the container acting up.
3. **Swipe left gently** and tap "Restart".

The whole process takes less than 3 seconds. No tedious login, no painful zooming. This sense of "control" is something you only understand once you've tried it.

### 3. Security is the Bottom Line

I know that trusting server management rights to an App is a high cost.

Therefore, Unraid Deck adopts the purest **API Direct Connection mode**.
*   **Zero Relay**: Your phone communicates directly with your server; data NEVER passes through any third-party intermediate servers.
*   **Zero Collection**: We do not collect your domain, IP, or any server configuration information.
*   **Biometric Security**: Supports Face ID / Touch ID lock, so even if you lend your phone, you don't have to worry about someone accidentally deleting your 40TB treasure trove.

## Start Experiencing It Now

If you are also fed up with the terrible experience of mobile browsers, why not give Unraid Deck a chance? It might not be the most feature-packed, but it is absolutely the smoothest to use.
