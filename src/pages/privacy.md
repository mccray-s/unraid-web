## 1. Data Collection

Unraid Deck does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. We do not have access to your server details, usage statistics, or API keys. All data remains strictly between your device and your Unraid server.

## 2. Local Storage

Your server configuration (IP address, port, server name) is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms. Sensitive information, specifically your API Key, is stored securely in the iOS Keychain.

## 3. Network Communication

The App communicates directly with your Unraid server. No traffic is routed through third-party servers. If you use a VPN or reverse proxy, traffic flows according to your network configuration.

## 4. Crash Reports

If you opt-in to share analytics with Apple, we may receive anonymous crash reports to help improve the app stability. These reports do not contain personal information.
